# Automation-of-eqipment-collection-for-the-PE-department

Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to automate the equipment collection process for the PE department of the college. Currently, the process involves students manually recording their equipment borrowing and return details in a register or notebook. They must also leave their ID cards as a kind of a mortgage which is only returned upon the return of the equipment. However, this system is out dated, cumbersome, and challenging to maintain.

Proposed solution:

To address the issues discussed previously, we propose implementing an upgraded system. In the new system, students will use their ID cards to simplify the equipment collection process. They will enter their names and register number, which will then be entered into two Excel sheets. When students return the equipment, they will enter their register numbers again, removing their names from one sheet and recording the return time on the other. This approach allows one sheet to track unreturned items, while the other sheet maintains the complete history of equipment transactions.

Advantages:

This automated system offers several advantages. It eliminates the requirement for students to surrender their ID cards as collateral, making the process more convenient. Furthermore, it streamlines the equipment collection process for the PE department, simplifying management and maintenance of equipment records. The two Excel sheets provide clear visibility into borrowed equipment and create a comprehensive history log, enhancing accountability and facilitating usage analysis. By automating the equipment collection process through the use of a biometric device, students' ID cards, and Excel sheets, your project aims to modernize and improve the management of equipment transactions within the PE department. This improvement will benefit both students and staff by streamlining the process and eliminating the need for ID card collateral.
